## Architecture

ScriptForge follows a clean, modular architecture with MongoDB integration:

```

```

### Data Storage

ScriptForge uses MongoDB for persistent storage:

- **Scripts Collection**: Stores test scripts with metadata
- **Executions Collection**: Stores execution history and results
- **Indexed Fields**: Optimized queries for search and filtering
- **Full-text Search**: Search across script names, descriptions, and tags

## Development

### Prerequisites for Development

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- TypeScript knowledge (helpful but not required)
- Basic understanding of Playwright
- AI Provider API key (Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up pre-commit hooks (optional):
```bash
npm run prepare
```

3. Start development server with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
npm run dev        # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build      # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm start          # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm run format     # Format code with Prettier
```

### Creating Custom Commands

You can extend ScriptForge's command understanding by modifying the AI prompt in `src/services/NLPService.ts`. The system uses a structured prompt template that maps natural language to Playwright actions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### AI Provider API Key Issues
- **Error**: "No AI provider API key found"
  - **Solution**: Ensure either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in the `.env` file
  - **Note**: API keys should not contain quotes or spaces
  - **Preference**: If both keys are present, Anthropic will be used by default

#### Playwright Installation Issues
- **Error**: "Browser executable not found"
  - **Solution**: Run `npx playwright install` to download browser binaries
  - **Note**: This requires internet connection and may take a few minutes

#### Script Execution Failures
- **Error**: "Script execution timeout"
  - **Solution**: Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts` or add explicit waits in your commands
  - **Example**: Instead of "Click login", try "Wait for login button to be visible, then click it"

#### Port Already in Use
- **Error**: "EADDRINUSE: address already in use"
  - **Solution**: Change the port in `.env` file or kill the process using the port
  - **Command**: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9` (on macOS/Linux)

#### MongoDB Connection Issues
- **Error**: "Failed to connect to MongoDB"
  - **Solution**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or check your Atlas connection string
  - **Local**: Start MongoDB service with `mongod` or `brew services start mongodb-community`
  - **Atlas**: Verify IP whitelist settings and credentials

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your commands, the better the generated scripts
2. **Use Selectors**: When possible, mention specific selectors or element text
3. **Add Waits**: Include wait conditions for dynamic content
4. **Validate Often**: Use the validate feature before executing scripts
5. **Save Progress**: Save your scripts frequently during development

## Advanced Features

### Context-Aware Test Generation

ScriptForge now analyzes target web pages before generating tests, ensuring accurate selector generation:

- **Automatic Page Analysis**: Discovers all interactive elements, forms, and their properties
- **Smart Selector Generation**: Prioritizes reliable selectors (data-testid > ID > unique classes)
- **Form Detection**: Automatically identifies form fields and submit buttons
- **Element Validation**: Ensures elements are visible and interactive before generating actions

### Custom Selectors

ScriptForge supports various selector strategies:

```
"Click the button with id 'submit-btn'"
"Click the element with class 'primary-button'"
"Click the button containing text 'Submit'"
"Click the third item in the list with class 'menu-items'"
```

### Conditional Actions

You can create conditional test flows:

```
"If the cookie banner is visible, click 'Accept All', then continue with the login flow"
"Check if the user is already logged in, if not, go to login page"
```

### Data-Driven Testing

Generate scripts with parameterized data:

```
"Create a test that logs in with different user credentials from a list"
"Test the search functionality with multiple search terms"
```

### Browser Context

Control browser behavior:

```
"Open in incognito mode"
"Set the viewport to mobile size (375x667)"
"Enable JavaScript debugging"
"Block all images to speed up the test"
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Minimize Screenshots**: Only capture screenshots when necessary
2. **Use Headless Mode**: Run faster by using headless browser mode
3. **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple scripts in parallel for faster test suites
4. **Smart Waits**: Use `waitForSelector` instead of fixed delays
5. **Resource Blocking**: Block unnecessary resources like ads or analytics

- [ ] Visual test recorder
- [ ] Test data management
- [ ] CI/CD integration templates
